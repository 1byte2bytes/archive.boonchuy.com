**Writing**

*“Matt had the brilliant idea to start “Anne or Beast” from Sprig’s point of view, then switch mid-episode to Anne’s. It was ambitious and a bit risky, but essential to establishing the world and characters the way he wanted. He had complete faith that the audience wouldn’t be thrown off by it, and he was absolutely right. It’s also funny watching that first episode and getting a glimpse of the Plantars pre-Anne, knowing that they’re missing a vital part of their family and don’t even know it yet.”*

*– Story Editor/Co-producer Jack Ferraiolo*

**Storyboards**

This episode was boarded by Bert Youn, Yonaton Tal, and Kyler Spears.  Revisions were done by Nate Maurer.  It was one of the first episodes boarded so we were still finding our voice.  Even so, you can feel the world and characters coming to life. The sequence where Anne and Sprig meet for the first time will always be one of my favorites:

**Character Design**

This episode was key in terms of introducing our core cast as well as some of the creatures that inhabit Amphibia. The shape language of Amphibia’s characters is deliberately soft and volumetric. The creatures and monsters however are intentionally jagged and horrifying. Artwork by Joe Sparrow, Erik Elizarrez, Daniaelle Simonson, and Carol Wyatt:

**Background Design**

Art director Ian Worrel and his team of did an amazing job establishing the intial look and feel of Amphibia with this episode.  The forest has the perfect blend of wonderment and intimidation while the town feels simultaneously exotic and incredibly cozy.  Artwork by Ian Worrel, Phillip Vose, Jules Itzkoff, and Amanda Winterstein.
